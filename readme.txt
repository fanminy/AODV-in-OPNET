¡ïRecord about Revising the Original NIST AODV & Own addition
--->1. In the Node Model of "aodv", it contains (from top to bottom):
	"module name"			"process name"
	   source			  source
	   sink		  	         aodv_sink
	 aodv_routing			aodv_routing
	wlan_mac_intf			aodv_wlan_mac_interface
	wireless_lan_mac		wlan_dispatch	(in 14.5)

--->2. Add two pipeline stage files: wlan_txdel_wsn (1st stage) & wlan_ecc_wsn (13th stage), which are the modifications of the original wlan_txdel and wlan_ecc in OPNET 14.5 respectively. You should compile these two files before running the simulation.
The two pipeline stage files have two functions: energy model (refer to LEACH) & communication range restriction.

--->3. the type of the field "Lifetime" in RREP packet is changed to "floating point" from "integer".


¡ïConfiguration specification
--->1. Open wlan_mac.pr.m using 14.5, compile it to replace the original objective file in 14.5, because I have modified this file. Don't worry, the original wlan_mac.pr.m in 14.5 is not replaced, we just want to get the modified objective file. (You'd better compile all process files.)

--->2. Network Model specification
      -->a. 3 nodes: node 0, the sink node ("MAC Address"=0, "Node Type"=sink, "source.Send DATA"=disabled),
			 for receiving data packets from other nodes;
		  node 1, the intermediate node ("MAC Address"=1, "Node Type"=sensor, "source.Send DATA"=disabled);
		  node 2 is the source node ("MAC Address"=2, "Node Type"= sensor, "source.Send DATA"= enabled, "source.Final Dest" = 0).
      -->b. Other attributes can be set in "Inputs->Object Attributes" when running the simulation. Please note that three file paths are needed to record data generated by simulation:
	->1st file: "sink.Sink File", Default setting:"C:\OPNET SIM\AODV for OPNET 14.5\result\sink.txt";
	->2ed file: "Invalid Time Record File". Default setting:"C:\OPNET SIM\AODV for OPNET 14.5\result\invalid time.txt";
	The "Energy" attribute assign initial energy to each node, so this file record which node has been energy exhausted during the simulation;
	->3rd file: "sink File Two".Default setting:"C:\OPNET SIM\AODV for OPNET 14.5\result\sink_two.txt";
